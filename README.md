# Higher_lower_Game  

This should be my first optimized game :) Although its command based and i need much more to learn, i am getting there lol
So in this Game you have to choose between 2 data given(data contains celebrities,counties,magazines etc), We need to guess which who has more followers.
If the player selects correct answer then we will move to the next guess and the data 2 will become data 1, The final score will be displayed after the game is over.
